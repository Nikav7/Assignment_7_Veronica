Model Training from Coqui TTS

In this Repo you will find 3 colab notebooks:

1) A Coqui TTS demo to try pre-trained models available --> coqui_test.ipynb

2) A Coqui TTS demo to train a model on LJspeech dataset - this notebook is intented to show the code used for training --> 

3) A Coqui TTS demo to train a model on a custom dataset - the Dataset is called ab_dataset and it has been built by me based on the voice of Alessandro Barbero, an italian professor. I took inspiration from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QAGk_rHipE

The original audio file used to create the samples for the dataset has been downloaded from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlqqCAPqMMw&t=1111s
I manipulated the audio file with ffmeg (conversion from .mp3 to .wav) and Audacity to split the audio based on silence. Then I converted the samples from stereo to mono with a samplerate of 22050 with the help of https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise.git

Link to download ab_dataset --> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Eexb1kB0zQUhnBpaQaIxEc7pTnwX61g?usp=share_link

Dataset has been constructed following LJspeech formatter as per this guideline https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formatting_your_dataset.html#formatting-your-dataset

Note: I am aware that even if the original audio is of public domain, its usage could be limited.
